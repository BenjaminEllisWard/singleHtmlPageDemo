# singleHtmlPageDemo
Showing a friend how a single file can be used by a browser to render a page.



### Demo
Here's a little something I put together to show how front-end code is used in web applications. Follow these steps:

- **Right click on your desktop background and select New>Text Document.** </br>
- **Copy the text from sampleFile.html and paste it into the text document.** </br>
- **Rename the text document to "testFile.html".** The file extension when you create the document is .txt. You can simply change the file extension when renaming the file to change the filetype. It doesn't matter what you name the file as long as you give it the .html extension. </br>
- **Open the file with the browser of your choice.** Once you change the file extension to .html, it should automatically open with a browser (your operating system keeps track of which applications open which file types) if you double-click the file's desktop icon. If not, right click and select "open with" to find a browser. </br>
- **Test the stuff on the page that opens in the browser.**

The idea here is that plain text (like you pasted into the text document) can be taken by some environment (a browser in this case) and executed. This specific example shows how a browser can render HTML and compile/execute javascript (languages included in the content you pasted) to display a webpage. The key here is that if you know the high level languages, the browser has the built in functionality to take your plain text and turn it into executable machine-level commands. One takeaway from this demo is that the common front-end languages (html, javascript, css) are valuable skills that can go a long way in landing a first development job.
